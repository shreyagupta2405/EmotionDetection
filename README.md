EMOTION DETECTION – A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS USING MACHINE  LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING

Research Paper submitted - ICDAM 2024 (publish awaited)

• Led a team of three in research focused on identifying and predicting emotions accurately from both visual and textual data using machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble models.

• Conducted comprehensive comparative analysis on the ISEAR and CK+ datasets, demonstrating that the ensemble models that are a combination of Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM models outperform individual models in accurately detecting emotions.
